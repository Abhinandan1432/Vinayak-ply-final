                    The most modern sort of plywood available in the Indian market is calibrated plywood. "What is
                    calibrated plywood?" you might wonder. If you're wondering about this, know that it's made with
                    high-end machinery to assure uniform thickness and size. Because of its consistency, it's an
                    excellent choice for building visually beautiful and highly useful modular furniture. Calibrated
                    Plywood is one of the most popular types of plywood among kitchen producers.
                    How Is Calibrated Plywood Made?
                    The calibrated ply production method meets the high standards demanded by kitchen manufacturers. It
                    is created by a two-stage procedure. To manufacture the combined core veneers without a face, the
                    first phase of the production process comprises a two-way hydraulic hot press. The veneers are then
                    delivered to imported calibrated equipment for calibration, resulting in consistently thicker
                    plywood. The plywood is then compressed with a face to produce a flawlessly polished calibrated
                    plywood. To get the required effect, some producers use sanding machines, adhesive spreaders, and
                    other tools.
